# Academic Projects
## Custom Image Processing
[Repository](https://github.com/TKEMPEGOWDA/Custom-Image-Processing)
- Implemented custom convolution operations from scratch for grayscale images, including Gaussian and mean filters, without using external image processing libraries.
- Designed and applied a separable Gaussian smoothing filter followed by gradient-based edge detection with tunable sigma and threshold values.
- Developed a Harris Corner Detection algorithm with non-maxima suppression and Gaussian-weighted corner metric computation using an 11x11 window.
- Constructed rotation-normalized gradient-direction histograms as local feature descriptors for each detected corner point.
- Matched corner features across two affine-transformed images and estimated the affine transformation matrix using a linear least-squares model fitting approach.

## 3D Animation & AR System
[Repository](https://github.com/TKEMPEGOWDA/3D-Animation-AR-System)
- Developed a 3D computer animation pipeline simulating rigid-body motion of a textured cube using geometric transformations and perspective projection in Python.
- Implemented custom line-drawing and texture-mapping algorithms for rendering polygonal surfaces without external libraries like OpenCV.
- Simulated realistic image formation through a pinhole camera model using time-varying translation, rotation matrices, and intrinsic camera calibration.
- Created an augmented reality system by overlaying animated 3D objects onto static background images with occlusion handling.
- Designed a stereo vision system producing red-blue anaglyph 3D video using dual virtual cameras to simulate depth perception for AR/VR applications.
